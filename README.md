# lock-control

My first project using Angular 2.0 for front-end . The system is a concept of a door-lock control system. The app is based on MEAN technologies. 

To run the project :

1. Install dependencies in main directory and in ./client directory.
```sh
$ npm install 
```
2. Start app from main directory by typing :
```sh
$ npm start
```
